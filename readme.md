# By100Devs

# Introduction
This project is a work in progress.
The MVP is to make a database of projects that have been created by 100Devs members.
Once that's done, it would be nice to add a feed that updates when members have publisheed a blog post, finished a new project, or announced that they will be speaking at a conference.

# Objectives
Awareness and community support. Why not use a tool made by a friend instead of searching the internet endlessly?
This way, you can also be part of the development process of cool features, or help to optimize the tool or service.

# Who is this for?
The platform is open to any 100Devs member.
